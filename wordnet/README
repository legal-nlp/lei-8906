first download the latest tab-separated distribution as explained in
[[https://github.com/own-pt/openWordnet-PT/tree/master/openMLWN][here]].

sort the wordnet data by lemma:
: sort -k 3 -t '	' wn-data-por.tab.txt > sorted-wn-data.txt

* check if in OWN-PT
to check if a sorted list of words (one per line) is in OWN-PT, find
which words are matched by a synset:
: join -t '	' -1 1 -2 3 mwes.txt sorted-wn-data.txt > result.txt

* check which lemmas are not in OWN-PT
- use tr to downcase the files:
  : tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'  < file > result
- sed to change =_= to = = (if freeling output)
  : sed -i -e 's/_/ /g' file
- note that we do not handle the decontractions made by freeling (do
  -> de o)
- join:
  : join -t '	' -v 1 -1 1 -2 3 lemmas-not-found-by-freeling.txt sorted-wn-data.txt > missing-lemmas.txt
